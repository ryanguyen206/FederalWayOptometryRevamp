# FederalWayOptometryRevamp

I know someone who works for a clinic and I visited their website and it looks very 2000ish. I wanted to redesign it as a project and hopefully for some pocket change but unfortunately the business owner declined my request.

I have a friend who is majoing in UI/UX design and I asked him to prototype one page and he was nice enough to make one for me so I will base the website off of his design.
